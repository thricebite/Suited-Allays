# Suited Allays

This resource pack personalizes your helpful allay companions by making them wear clothes! This was inspired by these [Minecraft skins](https://namemc.com/profile/thricebite.1) and the Pandaloon puppy costumes.

**Suited Allays uses and requires Optifine custom and random textures to function.** Other resource packs that also modifies allays using Optifine features *might* conflict with this resource pack. 
Here are some mods to enable Optifine custom and random texture features: 
- Entity Texture Features: https://modrinth.com/mod/entitytexturefeatures
- Optifine: https://www.optifine.net/home

Please check out the [gallery](https://modrinth.com/resourcepack/suitedallays/gallery
) to see what to rename your allays to, to get the corresponding skin.
